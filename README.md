# Dimensionality Reduction Techniques

This repository explores various dimensionality reduction techniques used in machine learning and data analysis. It includes Python implementations, mathematical explanations, and real-world applications for each method. Whether you're working on data visualization, feature extraction, or improving model performance, this repo has you covered.

## Techniques Included
The following dimensionality reduction techniques are covered in this repository:

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
- **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**
- **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)**
- **Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)**
- **Autoencoders**
- **Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)**
- **Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)**
- **Isomap**

Each method is explained in detail, and Python code is provided to help you implement them in your own projects.
